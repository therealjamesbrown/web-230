; Description:  This is a simple JavaScript 
program using values and variables with at least two errors.

The intended functionality is to set a variable to true, 
then check to see if it is actually true. If the variable is set to true,
the if statement should log "The variable is actually true to the console.
If the variable is set to false, it will log the variable is actually false
to the console"

//Start Program

/**
 * Expected output
 * The variable isTrue is actually True
 */


 

//variable declaration and assignment goes here
var isTrue = True;



//output
if (isTrue){
    console.lag(`The variable ${isTrue} is actually True`);
}else{
    console.log(`The variable ${isTrue} is actually false`);
}



//End program
